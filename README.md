# Node-js-MySql

## Overview

In this activity, we created a storefront using Node.js as out frontend and MySQL as our backend to log inventory. This app allows users to shop from a list of items available in our store. If an item is available, the user is notified of the total cost and the inventory is updated. If an item is unavailable, the user is prompted an apology message for the inconvenience and asked if they would like to continue shopping with our remaining items available.

## The App

### The user is initially prompted with a question to see whether or not they would like to shop.

### After that, the user can see the entire store products and inventory available.

### Finally, if the user wishes to continue shopping with us, the user can see a live update of the inventory being updated with the current available inventory.
